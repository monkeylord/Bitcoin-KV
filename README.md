## What Bitcoin Key-Value Storage Do?

Bitcoin KV Storage provide a cryptologic defined on-chain storage, which likes H5 localStorage but can be accessed everywhere with a single key.

One example of Bitcoin KV Storage is to store user's information on-chain, rather than on server. User's privacy is preserved, and by putting bussiness logic on-chain that cannot be tampered, most of bussiness logic can be run on client side, the interactions between client and server can be saved.
